{"name":"Bukkit Plugin Editor","tagline":"A mini-IDE for Bukkit plugin development","body":"### Welcome to the Bukkit Plugin Editor site!\r\nWelcome! This program is still in development, but you can take a look at its progress.\r\n\r\n###Purpose of this project:\r\nWhen I started programming for the Bukkit platform, I noticed how tedious it was to test a plugin. For me, testing plugins went like this:\r\n\r\n1. Write some code. <br>\r\n2. Export the code as a jarfile. <br>\r\n3. Copy the jarfile into the plugin directory of CraftBukkit. <br>\r\n4. Run the server, and test. <br>\r\n\r\nI found this workflow to be quite time consuming and possibly confusing, especially to new or younger Java developers who aren't as familiar with programming. The intent of this program is to integrate the development side of Bukkit development with the testing part. To give flexibility to the developer, the editor will be able to create, edit, compile IntelliJ and Eclipse projects. All it will take to test your code is simply click a button in the menu, and it will autmatically export your Jar and run the craftbukkit server on the local machine (127.0.0.1). \r\n\r\n###Planned feature list:\r\n-Internal server <br>\r\n-Import Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Maven projecs <br>\r\n-Automatically generate project files <br>\r\n-Automatically update Bukkit/CraftBukkit builds <br>\r\n-And more! <br>\r\n\r\nThank you for stopping by!\r\nWilliam Jen\r\n(collielimabean)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
