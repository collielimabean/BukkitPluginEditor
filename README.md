BukkitPluginEditor
==================

Hello all:

The Bukkit Plugin Editor is designed to unify the creation of Bukkit Plugins and the testing of them. What it will do is allow one to click a button and it will automatically boot a local server (127.0.0.1) and your plugin will be included with the server bootup.

Planned features for v1.0:

-Import/Export support for Eclipse/Netbeans/IntelliJ projects/modules

-Automatic plugin.yml and project generation

-Automatic updating for Bukkit/CraftBukkit

-Internal server with automatic compilation of project

-pom.xml generation if user requests

-Older Bukkit/CraftBukkit API support


This program will be available, with its source, under the GPL v3.0 license.


Thank you!
