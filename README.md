BukkitPluginEditor
==================

Hello all:

The Bukkit Plugin Editor is designed to unify the creation of Bukkit Plugins and the testing of them. What it will do is allow one to click a button and it will automatically boot a local server (127.0.0.1) and your plugin will be included with the server bootup.

Planned features for v1.0:

-Import/Export support for Eclipse/Netbeans/IntelliJ projects/modules
-Automatic plugin.yml and project generation
-Automatic updating for Bukkit/CraftBukkit
-Internal server with automatic compilation of project
-pom.xml generation if user requests
-Older Bukkit/CraftBukkit api support


Currently, this project is in the ALPHA stage. As such, the files provided in the download section may not be 100% reliable. If you would like to help, please contact me either through the Wiki or email (collielimabean@gmail.com).

Thank you!
